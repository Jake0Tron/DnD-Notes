# Session 9 - 22/09/2021

## After Roan

- Should we put the corpse back into his tomb? (Hex asks)
  - discussion on this
  - maybe yes, maybe no, we drop him or.. 
  - convoluted plan to drop a corpse into a tomb
    - Hex and Lazulia manage to get the Wight's body wet on their way to dropping it off to the tomb
      - they drop it off and put the lid back on
        - what do they see?
          - nothing (1)
        - welp, up we go
- We book it back down the blade hallway
  - I disarm it enough that nobody gets hurt
- We're back out in the main room waiting till the other 2 join us 
- Lets leave him and go look at the staff

## The Surface

- Lets get back up to the plateau where Reynora and I  saw the tendrils coming out of the top of the hill
  - Still some stonehenge kind of stuff going on
    - Boulders and rocks dispersed around the plateau
  - There's a staff planted in the ground, gnurled twisted wood, seems to be magically manipulated
    - tendrils spewing up out of the wood and back down around into the ground like fingers/hand
    - Jammed into the ground with some dirt offset
  - Mal casts moonbeam on it...
    - mass of plants growing out of the rock blow up into flames, and rises up
      - 2 large 'ent-like' feel slam down
        - Reynora totally warned us about this
      - here it comes
      - FIGHT!
        - god damn this thing is lorge
          - Plants from the ground!
            - Shambling mound goes down!
              - Reynora takes it to pppound town!
          - I yank out the staff with tendrils coming out of both ends
            - it's sticky
            - then I vomit everywhere
            - I drop it and I've got red stuff all over me
                - jump off the rock and stop vomiting when I let go of the staff
            - I go back and get it, and vomit more
            - we can't kill it
              - and it starts screaming
            - GORTEK ARISES
            - We moonbeam it and I hand it over to Gortek
            - we finally blow it up


## We busted the sticky stick

- Gortek breaks the stick and a little cloud comes out
  - "Weird stick"
    - Drinks stick blood
    - Hetz also drinks some
      - immune to poison
      - its blood flavoured
- Lets look at the huge mound of earthen beast
  - dozen or so of other mini mounds in the area that have gone inert
- Maybe we take a rest? a nap?
  - we count the money and short rest

## On the way to Aldrefield

- it's late
- thugs milling about, but we pass them without interest
- cross the bridge over the seam
- 2 stakes driven into the ground beside the statues
  - 2 figures hung by their necks from the stakes
    - I recognize them as the mother and the father
      - WELLLLL
      - guess I need to find the scaly girl, this must be her parents
    - Looks like the inn they were at is turned over, lets figure that out huh
    -

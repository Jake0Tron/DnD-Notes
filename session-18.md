# Session 18 - holy moly it's been a month... 1/12/2021

## To Anerith!

- Hundreds of bird-looking things above the city
- Contact (Devina) at the base of the city at the docks if we can't get in
- We're like a week ahead of the Kiddy-catcher templar, time to decide on a plan
- Residuum comes from the bones of dead primordials, like the one beneath Anerith
  - There are veins from when the primordial died, that get mined
- Reynora tries to disassemble the 'listening device'
  - rolled like fuckin 31
  - doesn't look like this is built to listen. Not magical, definitely mechanical

## The Slums!

- Notice a heavily armored woman riding away from the city
  - wearing exquisite plate armor, great sword and shield
    - Looks like Marshall Lumaris' armor
    - symbol of the platinum dragon, and the templar
- This place s huge!
  - Giant Primordial elemental holds up the hill
  - Giant waterfall
- Bird things are actually riders patrolling the city/sky
  - Hippogriffs/Gryphons
    - The SkyGuard
- Approach "the Steps"
  - guarded, some are being turned away
- We go into a shitty bar and drink shitty mudbeers, ask about Devena
  - Drink beers and go find Devina
- Devina wants us to help her move shit before she helps us get into the city
  - She and her brother were separated from parents
    - brother could cast spells or something similar, so both were taken
      - left in Anerith slums
- Hex, Mal and I go out drinking
  - "here's to secrets"
- we make our way home and take a long rest


## Wake up in Anerith Slums

- wake up and head to the stairs
  - gonna stash magic shit in the fish and try to get into the city
  - we get past guard without any trouble
- up the stairs we go
  - hit checkpoint, open a barrel for proof and move on


## Inside Anerith!

- Shops everywhere with all sorts of things
- We end up at an inn, Mal is friends with the owners

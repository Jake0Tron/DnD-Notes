# On the road again, to Ennisdale!

- We're in the cart, pulled over having a rest
- Not much happens for the rest of the night
- we head back onto the road
- some small talk amongst us as we ride along
  - travelers pass, leaving the city that we're headed to (Ennisdale, en route to Anerith)
- boring day, not much to be done. small talk and observing the landscape
  - forest, animals, etc
- late in the afternoon, we pass a rest stop for couriers
- Hear a scream up ahead 
  - man emerges from the trees
    - yelling for help
    - courier's bag pulling a horse
  - chased by a mound of earth, snaking through the earth
- Insectoid creature with claws and mandibles
  - rips the horse into pieces
  - spits at the guy, looks like dark yellow/green acid
  - INITIATIVE
    - oh damn this mantis thing can burrow
    - we blind it, which is good
    - Reynora shoots this thing to death, and it explodes, which spurts acid all over us
- Talking to the messenger (Eric Barker)
  - highway men
  - goblins
  - among other things assaulting him on his way to Aldrefield
  - he's gonna camp out with us tonight
- Oh god it's Gortek again... or is it?
  - Klysenes? (sp?)
- Lets set up camp

## Sleepover party!

- at some point we see a campfire on the horizon
  - fire is big... hear a faint scream some distance away
    - Reynora wakes Hex and then runs off in the direction of the fire
    - Hears some voices she can't understand
    - "commander" sounding one seems to hush them and command them
      - Reynora gonna hide
    - they're coming out her way, fanning out
      - couple larger (6') ones, rest seem to be smaller
        - goblins!
      - Reynora makes a slow retreat...
      - fires an arrow at their fire... (Nat 1)
        - they must have heard the arrow? 
        - She runs, so fast
  - Hex (on watch) hears some screams or something, can't tell
  - Reynora hangs outside the camp... and eventually makes it back, Hex didn't really notice her come back
  
### Well this is uncomfortable

- I wake up to a knife to my throat...
  - LAZULIA? (Klysenes)
  - Apparently a man trapped in a woman's body
    - "should be home, ruling my empire, *Thresanis*"
    - I convince him/her to let me go dig through the messenger bag of mail
      - find some business mail, addressed to Port Saltona, nothing of immediate notice
  - head back to the fire, but apparently Reynora hears something
    - like 8 goblins with a net or something?
  - I get embiggened!
  - INITIATIVE

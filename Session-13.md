# Session 13 - 03/11/2021

## Back at the bar, taking a long rest

- In our rooms...

### Hetz Dream

- Hetz finds himself in a sewer...
  - snakes... hundreds and thousands of snakes, summoned?
  - Looking out over a large city on top of a mountain
  - Some voice starts talking
    -  says "noctlu must be reclaimed"
    - "find thwantcle"
    - "integral to the nested veil"
      - There was a lot of hissing and words that didn't make sense here
    - "Soda has new goals"
    - Find him at the archives
    - Nested veil has regained strength

## The next morning

- Meet up for a quiet corner booth to discuss the previous night
- Some folks are hungover, others are in good shape
- Mal and Hetz disclose the offer from the 'Noble'
  - request for help on some sort of heist
  - The man who offered a job had the means to change his face
    - expects an answer from us this morning
- Lets investigate the town until we hear from/see the Noble
- Lazulia probably won't help with these missions given her piety, and "bosom-ness" (as she says)
- Splitting up, Hetz wants to get armor mended and the others head to see the Templars
  - Lazulia almost passes out, but comes to... oh boy

### In the city

- small market area, 
- guards keeping an eye
- Item shop and blacksmith there (seen previously)
  - Hetz wants armor repaired, "he'll see what he can do"
  - Heads to item shop
  
#### Item Shop

- large glass window
- Male elf behind the counter
  - birth mark on his cheek from bottom right to left eye
  - "Serathiel"
- Tools and gear around to look at
  - Some "non-tool" items behind the counter
    - some registered magical items
      - scrolls, potions
        - healing potion,
        - amulet - regain constitution/heal wounds after drinking
        - glass orb - provides light in the darkness
        - spell scrolls
          - offense, defense etc
  - Artisan's tools
  
#### Around the Market

- head through the market to the arches
  - lets go up to the top of the arches? maybe talk to templars
    - we get up there
      - and we find the office of the templars, not hard to see
      - Large doors with brass handles
    - Dwarf woman greets us
      - Marshall Lumaris seems to have left already
        - she's going to try to find him
        - Looks like he's out on business, headed to Anerith
          - returning the ones they found to be tried
        - Master is in though... could wait an hour
          - Not really worth it
        - Lets negotiate, she's obviously lying
          - Send him a message, we've killed off the undead, we have destroyed "the rod", he can collect the pieces if he's interested
          - She'll get the message across, they'll wait for us
        - Lazulia casts Zone of truth
          - That's magic in the magic hunters' house
          - Try to drag out Lazulia... Initiative
            - I hide
            - Hex tackles a guard who's on top of Lazulia
            - I try to impersonate the dwarf woman, and fail badly
              - probably zone of truth
            - We manage to escape, when Mal intimidates a load of them
            - we get out of the templar's guild, Mal pushes Lazulia and Hex off the arch
              - I try to act like the receptionist, and fail
              - escape by jumping off the arches and shifting through the crowd to escape the guard

##### Meanwhile...

- Hetz lingers, and finds the shapeshifter as one of the guards around the market
  - he found my message in the alleyway
- We head back to the Inn

### Back At the Inn...

- we're expecting company
- touch base about the bad time at the guild

## Furantur arrives

- Cloaked man with blond man approaches, tells us to keep templar talk down
  - ready to talk work
  - "never met another like me"
  - Work for an unnamed Organization, I guess you can call them the shapeless?
    - They call him **Furantur**, but that's not his real name
    - hired the 'empty hand' to help on a heist
      - steal something that doesn't belong in Freician possession
      - somewhere around outskirts of Eishmore he realized how drastic it is
      - found loads of dead bodies, might be chasing a **Tormentor**
        - might be a conspiracy that they actually exist
          - told as stories as you grow up
          - torture people who hide mages
        - think they're hiding at **Kira Lewis'** estate
        - New type of magic
      - Can be paid in cash, and what we steal from the estate
    - After Mal tries zone of truth
      - admits they're called the **'Fractum Ardentia'**
        - Rectum Ardentum? - Hex
    - Item stolen from under the king, possibly...
      - seems nervous/scared
    - **Kira Lewis**'s estate
      - heavily guarded
        - fairly standard, except for one
          - doesn't wear armor but seems to be in charge
            - Hasn't seen him up close
            - most guards wear armor, doesn't wear armor/weapons but has cloth wraps on their arms
      - Empty Hand insists they can navigate the sewers better than any other
      - no less than a dozen guards
  - What do we want as payment?
    - documents? payment? 
  - "now that you've seen our faces, your organization is one that we want to keep track of" (about Fractum Ardentia)
  - Should we trust the Empty hand to navigate the sewers?
    - Mal casts Augury to determine if we trust the Empty Hand
      - sneaky answer, sounds like they might betray us
        - Hetz leaves the bar "Give me 10 minutes!"
          - Kobolds are the ones keeping the sewers
          - People think monsters in the sewers or were-rats or something
  - Might be looking in the basement or the second floor
    - has a device that we can scout with when we get there
  - Let's keep them at arms' length while they lead us through the sewers
    - Hex and Lazulia might join them to help us gain some insight
  - How will we know you next time we might see you? 
    - "Hello it is Furantur"
      - hm, no, maybe not
    - take this coin, password is 'saltlick'
      - toss it if you're in trouble
    - we have a coin, password is 'fresh pepper'
  - I'm going to walk him out
    - handshake... 
      - Pete and repeat...
        - "I thought you were dead..."

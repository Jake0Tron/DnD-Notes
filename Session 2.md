# Session 2 - July 21 2021

  ## Post-battle
  - Confronted by a local guard
  - asked about zombies, if we saw magic
    - no, totally didn't... <.< >.>
  - We're looking for lodging of some sort
  - Cracked cup near the Gibson logging facility
    - **Owner of Gibson lodge is looking for help**
  - **Trev's new character shows up!**
    - super mad about his last character's death apparently
      - screaming about "Galdorian"
    - it uncle of dead one
  - Alito is cold as all hell, only after a coupla minutes
  - Drag the body out of town for a proper burial

  ## The search for Lodging
  - decide to head to cracked cup
  - walk past Statue of Female elf statue with bow, human with sword and shield in the center of town
  - Beggar children running around
  - Fat drunk old man passed out in the square
  - **Coffee is a thing**
  - See the swinging sign with a cracked coffee mug on it
    - **The Cracked Cup**

  ## Introductions
  - Meet Trev's character *"Mal" (Maltorio C)*
  - we all introduce ourselves as we walk to the Cracked Cup
    - I stay pretty quiet
  - Kids rob Hex, Mal gives them some copper
  - See carving saying *"peace and prosperity for all peoples of Acarri"*

  ## Inside the Cracked Cup
  - Gray-silver hair person behind the bar (wood-elf) __*"Carahar"*__
  - Gonna buy a drink for Mal because he lost a family member and I can relate
  - young man in the bar sitting with an older man and a Drow (wearing engraved armor), they're talking amongst themselves
    - This guy's (Drow Elf) a Templar
    - **"Marshall Lumaris"**
  - Converse about work to be done in the area
  - Head to bed
    - stay up late and crash in a random (rolled a 2 on 1d6) room
      - turns out it's friendly, Hetz's (Ben's character)'s room

# Session 7 - Sept 8 2021

## Reynora returns

- (definitely missed some info here)
  - ran into some undead folks
  - Vinny the pirate said that his payment was in the hills
    - hills rejected Reynora
    - White haired person was there apparently
  - We should rid the area of undead before maybe?
    - yeah, lets do that and possibly collect some loot
- Hex leads us towards where he thinks the hill is
  - 1h no zombies yet
  - 2h Looks good so far
  - 3h seems like this is actually working...
  - *Sudden temperature drop!*
  
## The Clearing 

- Some trees are dead
  - Very Very dead, no leaves and greyed wood
    - this increases as we get further into the wood
    - Lots more brush and shrubbery as we get closer
- See a cluster of huge boulders up on top of the hill
  - kind of stonehenge-esque
  - trees stop about 20 feet from the boulders
- I'm gonna break off with Reynora and get a look from the side while team examines the area
  - We're sneaky peoples
  - also perceptive
- Them guys go towards entrance (side of hill)
  - There's a roughly hewn stone staircase that decends into the hill 
  - Characters engraved on some of the stones
    - Lots of Elvish characters/letters
      - Within lies Rowan and his righteous guard, heroes of the great war
  - No noticable odour in the air, smells musty in the cave area
- We're looking on from the outskirts of the clearing, we see:
  1. Several sets of non-human tracks coming in and out of the area
      - fairly recent (less than a day)
  2. *Sound of a lightning strike echoing coming from the clearing*
     - wisps of black energy/smoke curling up from the center of the clearing
       - wisps almost looked like hands
       - 
- Regrouped
  - Mal saw the same magic as I did
    - might not be worth our time immediately
  - We're gonna go into the cave, with fancy dark vision from Mal
  
## Into the thick of it!

- We're in the cave!
- 15x15 room, empty

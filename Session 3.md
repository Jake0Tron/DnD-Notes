  ## What a night!
  - I woke up in Hetz's room, he's up praying
  - Templar is still here (**Marshall Lumaris**)
  - Lazulia tries to charms folks, doesn't seem to do much
  - Breakfast before we head out elsewhere 
    - they don't have NÃ¼gs of Chicken
    - So much eggs
      - Breakfast Roleplay is important
      -  Barkeep Mentions the Dynasty taking young kids to the tower
         -  I'm not happy about this (Brother)
         -  He's part of a movement
            -  Usher people into the unclaimed lands to escape the Templar
               -  Problematic given that a Templar is staying at the inn
            -  There were attacks on camps, Templars have a dislike for undead
            -  He needs our help, distract the Templar to transport a family with a young girl 
               -  I want to meet this girl (possible impersonation?)
               -  Can't persuade Carahar to meet this girl, will try again
                  -  holy shit 2 nat 2's and a nat 20 to make the save
               -  Trap door in the kitchen leads down to cellar
                  -  3 figures huddled down ther
                     -  human man, woman, and a young girl
                        -  Young Girl, 4-5 years old
                           - I told them that I'll keep them safe
                           - **"when I say run, you need to run"**
             - Leave the family, head back to the group
  
  ## At Gibson Logging
  - Investigate the area
    - Sleeping quarters, Offices and some landings above the work area
    - Someone is upstairs
      -  **Minnie Gibson**, Short human female, elegant workers clothing,
        - Looking for help to clear out zombies
        - 75GP/person for work
        - Most don't come back if they go into the woods
        - Monsters have shown up at both Robinson and Bennett companies, but hers seems to have been hit harder
        - Head North through the woods (more dangerous) or through logging trails (more confusing) past Robinson
          - Bennetts might have it out for her! 
            - Company Run by Alistar Bennett, soon to be taken over by Zac and Chester
          - **Not sure if the wood has shown signs of problems from undead**
        - Local thugs may be in the woods as well
  ## To the Woods!
  - Walk past the Inn that Hetz had previously been into
    - it's shitfucked, blood everywhere
      - Lets look in!
        - > famous last words
        - so much ruckus
          - smashed up stools (sitting kind), blood, etc
            - Zombies smashed this all up
              - not worth our time, this is commonplace
    - We have found the logging trail!
      - Looks used but woods look dark and hard to see through
        - Woods are hard to go through
      - Parts of the trail are overgrown, but not unmanageable
        - We get lost and it's...
  ## ZOMBIE FIGHTING TIME
    - this won't be fun
    - There are more zombies
    - So maany zombies...
    - oh cool, more
      - Lazzulia is stressed?

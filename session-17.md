# Session 17 - 2021-12-01

I destroyed last week's notes, but we basically went upstairs into the mansion and fought in a dark cloud against a tormentor and sets of animated armor and some bad guys, we cleared the bad guys and took the chest, blew it open and got the goods. Hetz found out that I was a changeling and the week ended.

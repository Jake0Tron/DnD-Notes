# Session 17 - 2021-12-01

I destroyed last week's notes, but we basically went upstairs into the mansion and fought in a dark cloud against a tormentor and sets of animated armor and some bad guys, we cleared the bad guys and took the chest, blew it open and got the goods. Hetz found out that I was a changeling and the week ended.

## Lazulia is blacked out

- Lasulia Had some tunnel vision
  - seeing stars, in some kind of weird space area
    - see 2 other beings, (dwarves)
      - male and female dwarves, unconscious
      - thin silver cord coming from their back going towards Lazulia
      - some other cords are thee, but don't connect
        - Lazulia has her own cord
          - ghostly cords, can't touch them
      - can move fairly easily, pretty quickly
      - Gortek is one of the beings? Cord shortens as she approaches
        - approach Gortek, seems to be unconscious
      - Looks around, another creature is floating through the void
        - covered in plates head to tail, has lobster-like claws, meanders through the void
          - this bih BIG like a city
      - Every so often the cords pulse with light, disappear and are replaced
      - Lazulia tries to connect to Gortek through command and Nat1's
        - Gortek approaches through the void
        - Grabs gortek's head and tries to connect...

  - Kira comes out, we bonk her and head down to the shitter again
  - let the servants out, send then to go pick up Kira
  - Down the shitter we go!

## Back to the Inn

- Reyna shows us the way out of the sewers (nat20) and we head back to the inn

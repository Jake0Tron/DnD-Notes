# Session 14 - 10/11/2021

## At the tavern, ctd. 

  - "I thought you were dead"
    - that makes two of us, you're not very good at hiding yourself.
    - Meet me by the stables
      - vanishes, I'll follow
        - sneak out and shift into a random as I head to the stable [23 stealth]
        - help him clear the stalls... [12 inv]
          - seems clear...
            - dagger at my throat
              - how did you know that phrase?
            - I shift into child me
              - I should ask you the same thing
            - He shifts into a pale, featureless face
              - yeah it's RePeat
              - We catch up, I guess... 
            - He's scared about the heist, seems a little more than he anticipated
              - We'll get each other out, if nobody else
            - I've got an idea, follow me
              - we jump up onto roofs
                - we can see the city
                  - the arches... ugh
                - see the market square
                  - foot traffic and the crowdfolk bustling around
                - "I wish I could run away from it all"
                  - runs into an alleyway, I follow
                  - Kind of a shitty spot
                - Pulls out a dagger
                  - I match
                  - Lets see what you can do...
                    - throws a dagger at me
                    - [ It's some kind of training montage ]  
                      - **I learn uncanny dodge**
                - Tell empty hand to meet him/us at the docks
                  - hands me his dagger
                - He disappears, and we part ways for now
                  - I hand him mine

## Meanwhile, at the pub...

- So uh, what now
- talking about people's opinions on magic
  - Lazulia obviously doesn't approve
  - Mal trying to clarify that magic goes both ways
    - We're getting dramatic now, aren't we
- Head out to shop 
  - Meet up at Terathiel's shop
    - Takes us down to his hidden area
    - **Allorim from Kaithe** delivers items
  
## The plan

- How do we deal with Kobolds in the sewer?
  - force?
  - money?
- What do we call ourselves?
  - The Sweaty Fist?
- We'll meet the empty hand at the dock

## At the docks

- we see folks we recognize
  - Perfection Tiefling plucking at a lute
  - Zhoe human flipping a coin
  - Look for Furantur around...
  - Call out to them
    - Oh, thought we only had 2
    - guess we're all hired on for the same job
      - Furantur "the homeless guy" hired us all
  - Hetz shakes Viksaren's hand
    - Hex and Lazulia are pulled into a sidebar with them
      - Hetz casts a sketchy message spell to try to eaves drop
  - I'm gonna watch for Furantur (RePete) to arrive while others try to eavesdrop
    - I see a homeless guy wearing a canvas sack
      - Salt lick, fresh ground pepper happens
  - Viksaren leads us down to the sewers 
    - Mal gives a Vigilant blessing for me 
    - Also dark vision for our team, not the empty hand folks
    - To the sewers!

## In the Poop Chute

- There's a big grate to the shitty sewers
- T-split in the pipes beyond the grate
- we enter the sewers
  - waste flowing out, paths on either side
  - | path |     poop     | path |
- Viksaren seems to know where he's going
  - crouching in the tunnels to navigate
    - claustrophobia sets in for us all...
      - I'm not doing so well...
        - 1 Level of stress :|
  - Hear flushing of water
    - poo water
    - Waterfall from either side 
      - We're going up the waterfall
        - Mal doesn't do it so good and gets some kind of poop all up on him
    - Most of us get up there fine... poor Mal
  - Slick goop oozing from the ceiling and down the walls
    - A Green slime!
      - Acidic
  - Reynora shoots at it...
    - Melts the arrowhead...
  - Viksaren walks face first into it
    - gets acid burned!
  - Mal blasts it after we all get past it
  - At this point there's a bridge!
    - crude wood, intentionally placed
  - We approach a large open area
    - going to see a "friend"
    - Large circular water pit, swirling
      - 30' across
  - "it's time you met our friend"
    - "NOW!"
      - looks at Hex/Lazulia
      - Lazulia pushes  Hetz into the swirling water pit
        - and he gets pushed in!
  - Zhoe is on the other side of the circle, as if to approach us from the rear
  - Doodie Elemental emerges from the water!
  -

  ## Strivena
  > Rebellion of mages beginning to uprise
  > 1091 AD

  {Lazulia} (Brian) meets me (Garth) in the forest, 
  - small talk, awkward as all hell
  - Hear something in the woods, can't see
  - Go investigate half-assedly, see nothing, so we keep walking towards the city
  - See <Hexagonal Strunk> Lucas walking ahead
  - [Alito] (Trev) and [Phaelin] (Sarah) come tumbling out of the bush into [Hex]
  - "We need to run"
    - Garth will definitely run with them
  - ZOMBIES!
  - also bees, but not zom-bees
  - Run into town and all fall down under the carriage that happens to be there
  - <Raynora>(Gilly) and <>(Ben) are there bickering 
  - **{{ ROLL INITIATIVE, ZOMBIE FIIIGHT }}**
  - Trev dies!
